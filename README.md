## 🧠 Project Overview

**SANJEEVANI** is an AI-powered wildlife protection system designed to detect potential poaching activity using **computer vision and acoustic gunshot detection**.

The system automatically identifies suspicious activity and alerts forest rangers in real time.

### Domains

Artificial Intelligence  
Computer Vision  
Edge AI  
Wildlife Monitoring  
IoT Surveillance

# 🌍 Problem Statement

Wildlife poaching is a major threat to endangered species worldwide.

Forest departments struggle to monitor vast forest areas because of:

- 👮 Limited ranger manpower
- 🌳 Dense forest visibility issues
- ⏱️ Delayed threat reporting
- 📡 Lack of automated monitoring systems

Poachers frequently operate with **firearms and camouflage**, making detection extremely difficult using conventional surveillance systems.

### 🎯 Objective

Develop an AI system capable of automatically detecting poaching threats using:

- 🧠 Computer Vision
- 🔊 Gunshot Audio Detection
- 🤖 AI-based Threat Classification
- 📱 Automated Ranger Alert System
